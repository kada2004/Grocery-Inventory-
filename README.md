# Grocery-Inventory-
I'm building a software in order to track my grocery inventory, Being able to know what I should buy or not when I'm going to the store and to track my expenses as well. And To know for sure in which types of food(Vegetables ...) i'm spending the most. This is just a first version 1 and working currently on the final version of this code.
